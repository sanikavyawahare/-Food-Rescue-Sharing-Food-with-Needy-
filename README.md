# -Food-Rescue-Sharing-Food-with-Needy-
 This project uses Salesforce to make it easy to share leftover food with people who need it. By organizing donations and managing pickups, we’re turning extra food into meals for the hungry. It’s a simple, effective way for communities to come together, reduce food waste, and help those in need.
